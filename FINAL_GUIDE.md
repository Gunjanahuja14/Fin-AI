## THE BILLS TAB - WHAT IT SHOWS:

The Bills tab detects **recurring expenses** (subscriptions, rent, utilities, etc.)

### How It Works:

1. **Log expenses multiple times from same vendor**
   - First: "Paid $15 for Netflix"
   - Later: "Paid $15 for Netflix again"

2. **App automatically detects pattern**
   - Shows: "Netflix - $15/month"
   - Shows how many times detected
   - Shows average amount

3. **Why it matters:**
   - Know exact subscription costs
   - Find unused subscriptions to cancel
   - Plan monthly budget
   - Identify where money goes

### Example Bill (after logging 2+ transactions):
```
Netflix
Paid for Subscription • Detected 2x
$15.00/month (avg)
```

### Getting Started:
```
💡 Try this: Log the same expense twice from 
the same vendor (e.g., rent on 1st and Netflix 
multiple times) to see recurring bills detected!
```

## QUICK START WORKFLOW:

### 1. **LOG EXPENSES** (💳 tab)
```

```

### 2. **VIEW DASHBOARD** (📊 tab)

```

### 3. **GET ADVICE** (💬 tab)
